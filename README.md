## Codebase

This repo codebase has two folders `backend` and `frontend`. And it supposes to be different repo with separate CI pipeline but for the clarity to navigate for this coding challenge I created a single repo.

Deployment for the single repo is hard so I created main Travis file that can create two branches and push backend and frontend to separate branch. Each branch will have separate Travis file so it run CI/CD.


## Frontend

Frontend codebase deployed to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and
you can access the frontend website in this [link](https://loving-jang-736a34.netlify.com)


## Backend

Backedn codebase deployed to [Heroku](https://heroku.com) and you can access the
API documentation by clicking this [link](https://leadbook-challenge.herokuapp.com/docs/)
