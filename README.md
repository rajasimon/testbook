## Codebase

This repo codebase has two folders `backend` and `frontend`. And it supposes to be different repo with separate CI pipeline but for the clarity to navigate for this coding challenge I created a single repo.

Deployment for the single repo is hard so I created main Travis file that can create two branches and push backend and frontend to separate branch. Each branch will have separate Travis file so it run CI/CD.
