## Codebase

This repo codebase have two folders `backend` and `frontend`. And it suppose to
be different repo with separate CI pipeline but for the clearity to navigate for
this coding challenge I created a single repo. 

Deployment for the single repo is hard so I created main travis file that can 
create two branch and push backend and frontend to separate branch. Each branch
will have separate travis file so it run CI/CD.
